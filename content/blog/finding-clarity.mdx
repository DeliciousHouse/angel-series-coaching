When everything feels urgent, it is easy to move fast without moving forward. Clarity starts with a pause and a simple structure.

## A 3-step reset

1. **Name the noise.** List everything competing for your attention.
2. **Choose the signal.** Identify the one outcome that matters most this week.
3. **Build a small plan.** Create three actions you can complete in the next 72 hours.
