Boundaries are not walls. They are agreements that protect what matters. When you lead with clarity, your relationships get stronger, not weaker.

## Three boundary phrases

- "I can do that by Friday, or we can adjust the scope."
- "I am at capacity this week, but I can revisit it next month."
- "That is important, and I want to give it my full attention."

### Your boundary checklist

- Is it clear?
- Is it specific?
- Is it kind?

The right boundary creates space for your best work and your best life.
